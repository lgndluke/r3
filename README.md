## :rocket: Quickstart
### Linux
1. Extract the REI3 package ([x64](https://rei3.de/latest/x64_linux)/[arm64](https://rei3.de/latest/arm64_linux)) to any location (like `/opt/rei3`) and make the binary `r3` executable (`chmod u+x r3`).
1. Copy the file `config_template.json` to `config.json` and fill in details to an empty, UTF8 encoded Postgres database. The DB user needs full permissions to this database.
1. Install optional dependencies - ImageMagick & Ghostscript for image and PDF thumbnails (`sudo apt install imagemagick ghostscript`), PostgreSQL client utilities for integrated backups (`sudo apt install postgresql-client`).
1. Register (`sudo ./r3 -install`) and start REI3 with your service manager (`sudo systemctl start rei3`).
### Windows
1. Setup the standalone version directly on any Windows Server with the [installer](https://rei3.de/latest/x64_installer).
1. Optionally, install [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) on the same Windows Server for PDF thumbnails.

Once running, REI3 is available at https://localhost (default port 443) with both username and password being `admin`. For the full documentation, visit [rei3.de](https://rei3.de/en/docs).

If you plan to run REI3 behind a proxy, please make sure to disable client timeouts for websockets. More details [here](https://rei3.de/en/docs/admin#proxies).

There are also Docker Compose files ([x64](https://rei3.de/docker_x64)/[arm64](https://rei3.de/docker_arm64)) and a [portable version](https://rei3.de/latest/x64_portable) for Windows available to quickly setup a test or development system.

## :bulb: Where to get help
You can visit our [community forum](https://community.rei3.de) for anything related to REI3. The full documentation is available on [rei3.de](https://rei3.de/en/docs), including documentation for [admins](https://rei3.de/en/docs/admin) and [application authors](https://rei3.de/en/docs/builder) as well as [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKb1YPyUV-O4GxcCdHc4Csw).

## :clap: Thank you
REI3 would not be possible without the help of our contributors and people using REI3 and providing feedback for continuous improvement. So thank you to everybody involved with the REI3 project!

[![Stargazers repo roster for @r3-team/r3](https://reporoster.com/stars/dark/r3-team/r3)](https://github.com/r3-team/r3/stargazers)

REI3 is built on-top of amazing open source software and technologies. Naming them all would take pages, but here are some core libraries and software that helped shape REI3:
* [Golang](https://golang.org/) to enable state-of-the-art web services and robust code even on multi-threaded systems.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for powerful features and the most reliable database management system we´ve ever had the pleasure to work with.
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to provide stable and efficient frontend components and to make working with user interfaces fun.

## :+1: How to contribute
Contributions are always welcome - feel free to fork and submit pull requests.

REI3 follows a four-digit versioning syntax, such as `3.2.0.4246` (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.BUILD). The major release will stay at `3` indefinitely, while we introduce new features and database changes with each minor release. Patch releases primarily focus on fixes, but may include small features as long as the database is not changed.

The branch `main` will contain the currently released minor version of REI3; patches for this version can directly be submitted for the main branch. Each new minor release will use a separate branch, which will merge with `main` once the latest minor version is released.

## :nut_and_bolt: Build REI3 yourself
If you want to build REI3 itself, you can fork this repo or download the source code to build your own executable. The master branch contains the current minor release, while new minor releases are managed in new branches.

1. Install the latest version of [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/).
1. Go into the source code directory (where `r3.go` is located) and execute: `go build -ldflags "-X main.appVersion={YOUR_APP_VERSION}"`.
   * Replace `{YOUR_APP_VERSION}` with the version of the extracted source code. Example: `go build -ldflags "-X main.appVersion=2.5.1.2980"`
   * You can change the build version anytime. If you want to upgrade the major/minor version numbers however, you need to deal with upgrading the REI3 database (see `db/upgrade/upgrade.go`).
   * By setting the environment parameter `GOOS`, you can cross-compile for other systems (`GOOS=windows`, `GOOS=linux`, ...).
   * Static resource files (HTML, JS, CSS, etc.) are embedded into the binary during compilation - so changes to these files are only reflected after you recompile. Alternatively, you can use the `-wwwpath` command line argument to load REI3 with an external `www` directory, in which you can make changes directly.
1. Use your new, compiled binary of REI3 to replace an already installed one.
1. You can now start your own REI3 version. Make sure to clear all browser caches after creating/updating your own version.
